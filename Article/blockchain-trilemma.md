Blockchain is not perfect just like any other solution. Compromise has to be made in order to trailer to specific use case.

There is 3 competing axis in this trilemma Decentralize, Security and Performance

Many chain and many network has been create but non of them can be considered a break through.
All of them compromise some axis to gain in the opposite axis

# there is many network

In order to help people comparing different chain quickly

# Criteria

Here I made a Radar chart in hope of quantified and comparing different blockchain solution.

This is just a proof of concept improvement is very much needed. and error is guarantee.
But the first step have been taken.

Next iteration will separate focus on separate blockchain in to different categories to make scoring easier.
